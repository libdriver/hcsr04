### Instruction

/src includes LibDriver HCSR04 source files.

/interface includes LibDriver HCSR04 gpio platform independent template.

/test includes LibDriver HCSR04 driver test code and this code can test the chip necessary function simply.

/example includes LibDriver HCSR04 sample code.

/doc includes LibDriver HCSR04 offline document.

/datasheet includes HCSR04 datasheet.

/project includes the common Linux and MCU development board sample code. All projects use the shell script to debug the driver and the detail instruction can be found in each project's README.md.

/misra includes the LibDriver MISRA code scanning results.

### Install

Reference /interface gpio platform independent template and finish your platform gpio driver.

Add the /src directory, the interface driver for your platform, and your own drivers to your project, if you want to use the default example drivers, add the /example directory to your project.

### Usage

You can refer to the examples in the /example directory to complete your own driver. If you want to use the default programming examples, here's how to use them.

#### example basic

```C
#include "driver_hcsr04_basic.h" 

uint8_t res;
uint8_t i;
float m;

res = hcsr04_basic_init();
if (res != 0)
{
    return 1;
}

...
    
for (i = 0; i < 3; i++)
{
    res = hcsr04_basic_read((float *)&m);
    if (res != 0)
    {
        (void)hcsr04_basic_deinit();

        return 1;
    }
    hcsr04_interface_delay_ms(1000);
    hcsr04_interface_debug_print("hcsr04: distance is %0.4fm.\n", m);
    
    ...
    
}

...

(void)hcsr04_basic_deinit();

return 0;
```
